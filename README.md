#Code Refractor

#Introduction
This project is an example of applying ARIA elements to your website. It points to good web design practice and some technicalities that should be present in your code.

#Technologies
This HTML and CSS boiler code was pre-provided. It has been edited to reflect proper practice, organizational structure, and correct accessibility features that should be standardized on all code. The image assets were also previously provided. Web accessibility should be at the forefront of all developers' minds. Integrating this establishes equality for all on the web. Being able to have a screen-reader interpret things that someone that might be a low-vision user is incredibly important. We are able to provide missing information this way and can allow all to inerpret the web development projects equally.

Specifically on this project, there are comments of specific changes that were made from the original code provided and listed the reasoning as well in said comments.
